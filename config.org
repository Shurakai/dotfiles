     The directory stack has normally unlimited size; if you want to restrict
     its size, set this variable to the value you want; you may also want to
     avoid duplicates in your stack, see [[#OPTION_PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS][OPTION_PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS]]
     for details.

     Here is an example of how ~DIRSTACKSIZE~ is used by ZSH:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       % setopt AUTO_PUSHD   # We want directories to be pushed automatically onto the stack (in this example)
       % dirs -v             # Displays contents of the directory stack; only the current direcory is in there right now.
       0       ~
       % for i in {1..2}; do # Let's change the directory a few times (for demonstration purposes)
           cd /tmp
           cd ~
         done

*** Changing Directories [100%]
**** DONE =AUTO_CD= (-J)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: OPTION_AUTO_CD
:END:

If this option is enabled, =cd= can be omitted almost always changing
directories; the only case where it is still required is if the directory
name happens to be equal to a command name. This option is very
convenient to quickly change directories, for instance
going one directory up becomes just =..= instead of =cd ..=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% mkdir directory
% directory
zsh: command not found: directory
% setopt AUTO_CD
% directory  # Now equivalent to 'cd directory'
% mkdir dir  # We create a directory that has the name of a command
% dir        # This is not equivalent to 'cd dir' because command 'dir' exists!
dir directory
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
setopt AUTO_CD
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc.default
setopt NO_AUTO_CD
#+END_SRC
**** DONE =AUTO_PUSHD= (-N)
     :PROPERTIES:
        :CUSTOM_ID: OPTION_AUTO_PUSHD
        :SEE: OPTION_PUSHD_MINUS
        :SEE: OPTION_PUSHD_SILENT
        :SEE: OPTION_PUSHD_TO_HOME
        :SEE: OPTION_PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS
     :END:

     If enabled, any =cd= command pushes the new directory onto the
     directory stack automatically; this comes in handy if you want
     to navigate between several directories without having to hassle
     with the stack by yourself.

     The see the contents of the stack, use the =dirs -v= command.

     The stack itself is by default unlimited in size; it can, however,
     be restricted by the [[#PARAM_SHELL_DIRSTACK][DIRSTACK]] parameter. This
     is often useful when =AUTO_PUSHD= is used. In case you don't want
     duplicate directories, set the [[#OPTION_PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS][PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS]] option.

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       % dirs -v           # Displays contents of directory stack
         0       ~
       % cd /tmp
       % dirs -v
         0       /tmp
       % setopt AUTO_PUSHD
       % cd ~
       % dirs -v
         0       ~
         1       /tmp
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
        setopt AUTO_PUSHD
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc.default
        setopt NO_AUTO_PUSHD
     #+END_SRC

**** DONE =CDABLE_VARS= (-T)
     :PROPERTIES:
        :CUSTOM_ID: OPTION_CDABLE_VARS
     :END:

     If set, any argument given to a =cd= command (or an implied =cd= if the
     [[#OPTION_AUTO_CD]] option is set) that is neither a directory nor starts with a
     slash will be expanded as if it were preceded by a "=~=". That is, you
     can assign directory names to a variable and then =cd= into that directory
     by passing the variable name as the argument:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       % dir=/tmp/      # Assign directory name to a variable
       % cd dir         # Note: We really mean "dir" here, not $dir!
       cd: no such file or directory: dir
       % setopt CDABLE_VARS # Now activate this option
       % cd dir         # Now it works - we will switch to /tmp now, displayed as ~dir.
       ~dir
       % pwd
       /tmp
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     This feature is very helpful if there are directories that you need to
     =cd= into frequently, such as folders containing projects you're working on.

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
      setopt CDABLE_VARS
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc.default
      unsetopt CDABLE_VARS
     #+END_SRC

**** DONE =CHASE_DOTS=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: OPTION_CHASE_DOTS
:END:

This option resolves directories to its physical directory if =..= is encountered anyhwere in the path
(or if only =cd ..= is used). This means that the working directory is fully resolved once =..= is encountered.

This option is similar to [[#OPTION_CHASE_LINKS]]. But as the name suggests, =CHASE_LINKS= is an option
used to resolve symbolic links to the physical directory whereas this option works on standard
directories as well.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% unsetopt CHASE_DOTS
% mkdir /tmp/example/
% ln -s /home/ch /tmp/example/link
% cd /tmp/example/link
% cd ..
% pwd
/tmp/example
% setopt CHASE_DOTS
% cd /tmp/example/link # Changes to /home/ch, but that is not yet resolved as no .. has been found
% cd ..
% pwd
/home
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
unsetopt CHASE_DOTS
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc.default
unsetopt CDABLE_DOTS
#+END_SRC

**** DONE =CHASE_LINKS= (-w)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: OPTION_CHASE_LINKS
:END:

If this option is set, if you pass a symlink to =cd= (or even a symlink as a part
of the path you pass), each symlink will be resolved to the actual folder.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% ls -ald *(@) # Show all symlinks in the current folder
lrwxrwxrwx 1 ch ch 24 Jun 22 19:56 homedir -> /home/ch
% unsetopt CHASE_LINKS
% cd homedir
% pwd
homedir
% cd # assume that this command brings me back to the previously active directory (cd -1)
% setopt CHASE_LINKS
% cd homedir
% pwd
/home/ch
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note: You can also achieve this behavior by passing the =-P= option to =cd=.

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
unsetopt CHASE_LINKS
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc.default
unsetopt CDABLE_VARS
#+END_SRC

**** DONE =POSIX_CD=

Changes the behavior of the =cd, chdir, pushd= commands for increased POSIX standard compliance.

If =POSIX_CD= is not set, the behavior of the =cd= command is described in the manual under [[https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html#Shell-Builtin-Commands][zsh: 17 Shell Builtin
Commands]].

If =POSIX_CD= is set, the behavior is changed in several ways:
 
1. =cd= will now first test if any directory in the =cdpath= / =CDPATH= variable contain the directory and
   if so, will change to that directory. Any directory under the current working directory is
   ignored - i.e., the directories listed in =cdpath= have a higher priority.
2. =cd= will no longer take arguments of the form ={+|-}n=, i.e., navigating the directory stack is no
   longer possible. (See related options such as [[#PUSHD_MINUS]].)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% unsetopt POSIX_CD
% mkdir /tmp/foo
% mkdir /tmp/foo/bar
% mkdir /tmp/bar
% cdpath=(/tmp)
% cd /tmp/foo
% cd bar
% pwd
/tmp/foo/bar
% cd /tmp/foo
% setopt POSIX_CD
% cd bar
% pwd
/tmp/bar
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
unsetopt POSIX_CD
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc.default
unsetopt POSIX_CD
#+END_SRC
   
**** DONE =PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS=
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: OPTION_PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS
     :END:

     If set, this option prevents any directory to be at two different
     positions in the stack; that is, every entry is unique.
     This option is especially useful if [[#OPTION_AUTO_PUSHD][AUTO_PUSHD]] is set.

     The following example demonstrates that duplicates are prevented:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        % dirs -v
          0       ~
        % setopt PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS
        % cd /tmp
        % dirs -v
          0       /tmp
          1       ~
        % cd ~
        % dirs -v       # Here, the existing entry for ~ was removed and a new entry was pushed onto the stack
          0       ~
          1       /tmp
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
       setopt PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc.default
       setopt NO_PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS
     #+END_SRC

**** DONE =PUSHD_MINUS=
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: OPTION_PUSHD_MINUS
     :END:

     The =cd= and =popd= builtins can use the directory stack by the =+/-=
     arguments. For instance, =cd +1= switches to the directory represented
     by the second element on the directory stack (as counting starts from
     0) and =cd -1= does the same but starts counting upwards from the bottom
     of the stack. (So =cd -1= is the second last element.)

     (Note: The content of the directory stack can be displayed with the =dirs=
     builtin; use =dirs -v= if you want to see explicitly the position of
     each element.)

     The meaning of =+= and =-= in this context can be reversed by activating
     this option:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        % pushd /tmp
        /tmp ~
        % pushd /bin
        /bin /tmp ~
        % pushd /boot
        /boot /bin /tmp ~
        % setopt PUSHD_MINUS
        % cd -1
        /bin
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
        setopt PUSHD_MINUS
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc.default
        setopt NO_PUSHD_MINUS
     #+END_SRC


**** DONE =PUSHD_SILENT= (-E)
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: OPTION_PUSHD_SILENT
     :END:

     If unset (as is the default), ZSH will print the content of the
     directory stack every time =pushd= or =popd= is used; with this option
     enabled, any output will be suppressed.

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        % cd /bin
        % pushd
        ~ /bin
        % setopt PUSHD_SILENT
        % cd /tmp
        % pushd                     # Doesn't output anything anymore
        % dirs -v
        0       /bin
        1       /tmp
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
       setopt PUSHD_SILENT
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc.default
       setopt NO_PUSHD_SILENT
     #+END_SRC


**** DONE =PUSHD_TO_HOME= (-D)
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: OPTION_PUSHD_TO_HOME
     :END:

     If enabled, executing =pushd= without any parameters is the same as
     executing =pushd $HOME=; this is also the case (even with this option
     disabled) if the directory stack contains only one entry:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        % cd /tmp
        % dirs
        /tmp
        % setopt NO_PUSHD_TO_HOME
        % pushd
        ~ /tmp
        % pwd
        /home/ch
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     If there is more than one entry on the stack and this option is unset,
     then calling =pushd= will simply swap the first two entries on the
     stack:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        % pushd /tmp
        /tmp ~
        % pushd /bin
        /bin /tmp ~
        % pwd
        /bin
        % pushd
        /tmp /bin ~
        % pwd
        /tmp
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     This behavior changes when this option is enabled:

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        % setopt PUSHD_TO_HOME
        % pushd /tmp
        /tmp ~
        % pushd /bin
        /bin /tmp ~
        % pushd
        ~ /bin /tmp ~
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     Note: If you don't want the stack to contain duplicates as
     in the example above, use the [[#OPTION_PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS][PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS option]].

**** STARTED =BASH_AUTO_LIST=

**** DONE =COMPLETE_ALIASES=

     If this option is enabled, aliases will not have the same completion as
     the command they are referring to as they are not internally substituted when
     completion is attempted; hence, aliases look like distinct commands to
     the completion.

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
       setopt NO_COMPLETE_ALIASES
     #+END_SRC

**** DONE =COMPLETE_IN_WORD=
     :PROPERTIES:
        :CUSTOM_ID: COMPLETE_IN_WORD
     :END:

     If enabled, completion can be called from within a word; the completion will
     then try and take both everything before and everything after the cursor
     into account: The position of the cursor determines where the completion
     is attempted.

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       % setopt NO_COMPLETE_IN_WORD # Disable this option first; default behavior
       % ls te*
       terr  test1
       % vi te<CURSOR:TAB>1 # Offers terr and test1 as completion
       % setopt COMPLETE_IN_WORD
       % vi te<CURSOR:TAB>1 # Completes to test1, as terr has no "1" at the end
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
       setopt COMPLETE_IN_WORD
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc.default
       setopt NO_COMPLETE_IN_WORD
     #+END_SRC

**** DONE =GLOB_COMPLETE=

     If this option is set, expanding a (glob) pattern will not insert all
     the matches but instead generates a list that can be cycled through like
     [[#MENU_COMPLETE][MENU_COMPLETE]].

     A =*= is added to the end of the word or at the position of the cursor,
     if [[#COMPLETE_IN_WORD][COMPLETE_IN_WORD]] is set; furthermore, as pattern
     matching is used, this option also affects any completion for options,
     user names etc.

     Note: If pattern matching is employed, you cannot use matching control
     to include constraints such as case-insensitivity or anchored matching.
     However, this limitation only applies when the current word contains
     a pattern; simply turning on the =GLOB_COMPLETE= option does not have
     this effect.

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       % setopt NO_GLOB_COMPLETE # Disable this option first; default behavior
       % ls example*
       example1 example2
       % cat example<TAB>   # becomes cat example1 example2
       % setopt GLOB_COMPLETE
       % cat example<TAB>   # asks for completion: Only example1 or example2 is selected.
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
       setopt NO_GLOB_COMPLETE
     #+END_SRC

**** TODO =HASH_LIST_ALL= <D>

This option is required for completion.

To understand why, consider what happens when you want to execute a command: first, ZSH determines the exact path of the command by searching all directories
listed in the =PATH= variable (with directories listed in the order of priority, i.e., from highest
priority to lowest priority). To speed up consecutive searches, ZSH fills a /hash-table/ with key-value
pairs for every directory listed in =PATH= that it has previously searched, where the key is the command and the value is the path of the first occurrence of that
command (i.e., only the very first occurrence in a folder in =PATH=). That is, when you execute the
next command, ZSH first checks if the command is already known by searching the hash-table and only
restarts scanning all directories if it has not yet been added.

ZSH doesn‘t need to search all folders but only until the first match for the command has been found. As a consequence, not
all commands are added to the hash table until all directories have been scanned. To enforce
searching all directories immediately, and not just until the first match, =HASH_LIST_ALL= can be set, even though the first scan is a bit slower since more
directories are fully scanned.

Note that, if =HASH_LIST_ALL= is not activated, then command completion is not available - as there is no guarantee
that all directories have been scanned, no guarantee exists that all commands are available for completion.

Note: This hash-table can be printed using the =hash= built-in command (and regenerated using the =rehash= command).

#+begin_example

     If set, this option reduces the size of the completion menu by making its
     columnwidth dynamic; that is, the width of columns will be determined by
     the content of the columns and each two columns might have different widths.

**** DONE =MENU_COMPLETE= (-Y)
     :PROPERTIES:

     On an ambiguous completion, do not beep and show a menu with matches; the
     first match is inserted immediately.  If completion is requested again,
     cycle through matches, and remove any changes made by a prior match.  When
     there are no more matches, go back to the first one.
     =reverse-menu-complete= may be used to loop through the list in the other
     direction. This option overrides AUTO_MENU.

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       % setopt MENU_COMPLETE

     ZSH tries to protect the user from accidentally deleting all files in a directory;
     that is, ZSH complains when =rm= is used and a =*= occurs in your filematching
     pattern; ZSH does not complain, however, if you deliberately expand this pattern
     (as you will see exactly which files are selected).

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        % rm ./*
        zsh: sure you want to delete all the files in /tmp/test/. [yn]?

     This is helpful to prevent you from wiping your data accidentally;
     in case you don't want to confirm that you're really sure, turn
     this option on - ZSH will not ask again.

     If [[#RM_STAR_SILENT]] is not set (that is, you need to confirm if you try

     ten seconds before you can even answer "yes" or "no".

     The motivation for this option is to prevent the user from hitting "yes"
     in a reflex.

     Note: If you expand the =*=, you do not have to wait ten seconds to delete
     the files you want. This is helpful if you /really/ want to use the =*=.

*** Job Control [88%]
**** DONE =AUTO_CONTINUE=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: OPTION_AUTO_CONTINUE
:END:

When starting jobs from your shell, they are owned by that shell and exhibit behavior that is often
dependent on the shell‘s process; for instance, if you send a SIGHUP (/signal hang up/) to the shell,
that signal would also be send to all jobs executed under that shell. (See the output of the =jobs=
command if there are any.)

#+begin_example
zsh─┬─eog───5*[{eog}]
    └─some_other_process
#+end_example

If you want to remove a process from a shell‘s job list (and hence change the way it responds to,
e.g., a SIGHUP) you can use the builtin =disown= to do so. Once you have disowned the process, you can
no longer use =bg= and =fg= on that process to run it in the background or the foreground.

What =AUTO_CONTINUE= does is that it automatically sends a =SIGCONT= (/signal continue/) to the process
when =disown= is used.

#+begin_example
% unsetopt AUTO_CONTINUE
% eog .
# Now I press Control-Z in order to move the process to the background; this is because I have
# used the following in my config:
# zle -N foreground-vi
# bindkey '^Z' foreground-vi
zsh: suspended  eog .
% jobs
[1]  + suspended  eog .
% # Typing exit here would kill the subprocess as well
% # Typing kill %1 would kill the subprocess (but not the shell)
% disown %1
disown: warning: job is suspended, use `kill -CONT -82336' to resume
# The process is still halted, hence cannot be used. However, you could send a SIGCONT manually to
# the process to continue it: kill -CONT -82336
% jobs # No output, as no more jobs are active
% kill %1
kill: %1: no such job
% kill 82336 # Kill the above process
# And now for the opposite ...
% setopt AUTO_CONTINUE
% eog .
^Z # See above (foreground-vi)
zsh: suspended  eog .
% disown %1
[1]  + continued  eog . # The CONT signal is now sent automatically
% jobs
% # Still no jobs!

     Many options in ZSH also have one-letter shortcuts assigned to
     them, making it very quick to enable/disable specific options; in fact,
     there are two different sets of one-letter
     options. The first one is the "default" zsh set and used by default;
     the second one is used to emulate sh/ksh options.

     Take for example the [[#OPTION_NOTIFY][NOTIFY option]]: The default one-char option is =-5=,
     but if =SH_OPTION_LETTERS= is set, the one-character option becomes =-b=.

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        % setopt NO_SH_OPTION_LETTERS   # Default
        % setopt -b                     # Try to set the NOTIFY option
        setopt: bad option: -b
        % setopt SH_OPTION_LETTERS
        % setopt -b                     # This command was now successful
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
       setopt NO_SH_OPTION_LETTERS
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc.default
       setopt NO_SH_OPTION_LETTERS

     This option starts ZSH in overstrike mode; to quote [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overstrike][Wikipedia]]:

     #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      In typography, overstrike is a method of printing characters that are missing from the printer's character set.
      The character was created by placing one character on another one — for example, overstriking "L" with "-" resulted in printing a "Ł" character.  
     #+END_QUOTE

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc

**** TODO =SINGLE_LINE_ZLE= (-M) <K>
**** DONE =VI=
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: OPTION_VI
     :END:

     This option changes the ZSH keybindings (for interactive shells) to
     behave like VI; for emacs users, option [[#OPTION_EMACS][EMACS]] is

     This option, if enabled, does the same as

        : % bindkey -v          # Enables the vi-keymap
        : % unsetopt EMACS      

     Unsetting this option, on the other hand, has no effect.

     Please note that just because this option is set, the vi-keybindings are
     not guaranteed to be enabled (i.e., your scripts must not rely on this
     option to determine whether the vi-keymap is activated or not):

     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        % setopt VI
        % bindkey -lL main 
        bindkey -A viins main
        % bindkey -e
        % bindkey -lL main 
        bindkey -A emacs main
        % [[ -o VI ]] && print "VI still enabled!"
        VI still enabled!
     #+END_EXAMPLE

     This option is just provided for compatibility reasons; you should
     always prefer to use the =bindkey= builtin.

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc
        setopt VI
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC zsh :tangle zshrc.default
        setopt NO_VI
     #+END_SRC
